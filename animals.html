		<h2>Great White Shark</h2>
		<p>As long as I can remember, my favorite animal has been the Great White shark (<i>carcharias carcharodon</i>)!</p>
		<p>A lot of people think they're ugly or scary, but just look at that face!</p>

		<p>I like these sharks because they are apex predators that rule the oceans!</p>
